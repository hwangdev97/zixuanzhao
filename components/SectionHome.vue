          My research interest is the issue of cultural self-identification and politicization recognition in Arab
          Canadian
          cinematographic products. I am particularly interested in how those filmmakers reconcile with their multiple
          layers of the cultural identity of being Arab and Canadian at the same time. That's to say, do they show a
          specific preference towards one of the identities? Why?

          Outside my dissertation, I am also interested in the evolvement of transnational films and series in various
          countries or regions—especially in Asian regions—with the advent of streaming platforms, such as Netflix, Amazon
          Prime, Crave, and Disney+.
